- MININUM NUMBER OF ENTRIES

One of the main problems with !NADA is that if we have few entries 
to calculate baseline, we gonna create quite a lot of false positives.
To solve this I think we need to implement the following:

	- Insert a fixed mininum number of entries for baseline 
	  calculation
	- Use script returned value if number of entries < mininum 
	  number of entries
